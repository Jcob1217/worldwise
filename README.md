The web application serves as a tool for tracking travels and registering exciting adventures. Its primary function is to empower users to document their journeys and visualize them on an interactive map. The application is crafted using React, with navigation facilitated by the react-router-dom library and state management handled through the context API.

Notable Features:

Adventure Registration: Users can effortlessly record their visited cities by completing a user-friendly form. This form typically collects information such as city name, visit date, and any personalized details they want to include.

Map Visualization: The application integrates a dynamic map component, pinpointing each city the user has explored. Clicking on a marker provides in-depth insights into the city and the user's experiences there.

React Router: For seamless navigation, the react-router-dom library is employed, enabling users to transition between different sections of the application, such as the homepage, the registration form, and the map view.

Context API for State Management: The context API streamlines application state management, promoting efficient data sharing between components. This eliminates the need for cumbersome prop drilling and ensures smooth tracking and updating of the user's travel data.
